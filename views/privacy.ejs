                            <p class="sub-par-priv-pg">We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users, regardless of their location.</p>
                            <p class="sub-par-priv-pg">You can update certain information by accessing your profile via “Settings.” You can also unsubscribe from certain emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link they contain.</p>
                            <p class="sub-par-priv-pg">Individuals in the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the Philippines have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.</p>
